## Techtile plotter (in Python Plotly)

Plotly code example to automatically plot any room (based on ground vertices and height), and a measured value at certain positions (example 1).
An overview plot of the room with directivities is shown in example 2. It could take some time to open that second plot.

The input parameters are shown in the examples. Normally these come from csv files etc. but here for the examples some simple numpy arrays are made.
